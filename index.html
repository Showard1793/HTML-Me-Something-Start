               In the faraway land of home-to-home, 
               Kaia awaited her next great adventure. As a stray in the mean streets of St. Louis, 
               her life was never easy. To say it bluntly, she scrounged by - living meal to meal
               and dealing with a  colorful arrray of cads and scoundrels to make ends meet.
               Yet, through it all, her spirit remained unbroken, her heart full of hope for
               a better tomorrow.
