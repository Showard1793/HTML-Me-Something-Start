               In the faraway land of Pacific, Missouri, Kaia awaited her next great adventure.
               She had now spent her third week at the Home-2-Home Inn, and while it did offer a
               temporary respite from the wilds she had grown accustomed to, the smells in the air
               taunted her daily and served as a constant reminder that there was more to life than
               waiting in a cage—even if it did mean safety, a guaranteed meal, and the occasional 
               scratch behind the ear.

            <p>
               As a stray from the mean streets of St. Louis, her life was not always easy. 
               To put it bluntly, she scrounged by—living meal to meal and dealt with an 
               colorful array of cads and scoundrels to make ends meet. Yet, through it all, 
               her spirit remained unbroken, her heart full of hope for a better tomorrow.

               One crisp evening, after a particularly unremarkable kibble dinner, two dim 
               lights pierced the darkness. The sound of gravel crunching signaled the arrival
               of a car. So many cars had come before, bringing with them humans—the strange 
               two-legged folk who spoke far more than they listened and, while not noseless,
               might as well have been. But this couple seemed different from the ones before.
               After a short conversation with the Innkeeper, the couple approached with a leash. 
               Kaia's new advendture had just begun.
